It appears you are referring to **Marcus Aurelius**, the Roman Emperor and Stoic philosopher. Marcus Aurelius died on **March 17, 180 AD**, while he was on a military campaign in what is now northeastern Austria (the ancient city of Vindobona, present-day Vienna).

### Cause of Death

The exact cause of Marcus Aurelius's death is not definitively known, but historical accounts suggest the following possibilities:

1. **Illness:** It’s widely believed that Marcus Aurelius succumbed to an illness. During his reign, the Roman Empire was grappling with the **Antonine Plague** (also known as the Plague of Galen), a devastating pandemic that is thought to have been either smallpox or measles. This plague caused widespread mortality and may have contributed to his death.

2. **Natural Causes:** Given his age at the time (he was about 58 years old, which was relatively old for that era) and the stresses of military campaigns, natural causes cannot be ruled out. Chronic illnesses or other health issues might have played a role.

3. **Service-Related Strain:** Leading military campaigns often took a toll on emperors. The combination of warfare stress, harsh conditions, and limited medical knowledge of the time could have exacerbated any existing health problems.

### Aftermath

After his death, Marcus Aurelius was succeeded by his son, **Commodus**, who became one of the more controversial Roman emperors. Marcus Aurelius is often remembered for his philosophical work, **"Meditations,"** which offers profound insights into Stoic philosophy and personal virtue.

### Summary

While the precise cause of Marcus Aurelius's death remains uncertain, it is most commonly attributed to an illness—potentially the Antonine Plague—or natural causes exacerbated by his responsibilities and the conditions of his military campaigns.
