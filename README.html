<h1>wxAI</h1>
<h2>Desktop OpenAI Query Agent</h2>
<p>wxAI is a <em>light</em> version of GptGUI.</p>
<p>wxAI is written in Python3 with the wxPython GUI package producing a GTK look and feel
on Linux and a true <em>light</em> theme look on Windows.</p>
<p>wxAI has fewer options than GptGUI and the <code>options.ini</code> file must be edited manually.</p>
<p>The <strong>Export</strong> button converts the markdown response to HTML and presents it in the
system default browser. The other functions are self explanatory.</p>
