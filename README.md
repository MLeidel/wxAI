# wxAI
## Desktop OpenAI Query Agent

wxAI is a _light_ version of GptGUI.

wxAI is written in Python3 with the wxPython GUI package producing a GTK look and feel
on Linux and a true _light_ theme look on Windows.

wxAI has fewer options than GptGUI and the `options.ini` file must be edited manually.

The **Export** button converts the markdown response to HTML and presents it in the
system default browser. The other functions are self explanatory.
